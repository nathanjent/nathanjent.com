Work in progress to create a framework for my personal web site using [Rust](rust-lang.org). I already pay to host some Wordpress on a LAMP server I figured I could finally learn how all this stuff worked.

# Technologies used
- Rust for routing. I guess you could call this a LAMR stack. I plan to add MySql database handling and HTML generation from some markup language at some point.
- Vagrantfile included to test on a Debian LAMP stack based on [this.](https://github.com/panique/vagrant-lamp-bootstrap)
- Makefile to build with Cargo and deploy to generated VM.
